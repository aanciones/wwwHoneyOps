# Alert Types Documentation

This document describes the **types of alerts** generated by the system .  
It focuses on *what alerts represent*, *when they are created*, and *how they behave over time*, without exposing internal implementation details.

---

## Overview

Alerts are created automatically when activity is detected from a source IP interacting with a honeypot.  
They are designed to group related activity, reduce noise, and keep users informed through timed notifications.

An alert represents **ongoing or repeated activity from the same source**.

---

## Alert Lifecycle

An alert goes through the following stages:

1. **Creation**
2. **Activity aggregation**
3. **Notifications**
4. **Automatic closure**

---

## Alert Creation

A new alert is created when:

- Activity is detected from a source IP that has **no recent active alert**
- OR the previous alert for that source has been **inactive for a configured period**

Each alert is uniquely associated with:

- An account
- A honeypot
- A source IP address

---

## Alert Rotation (New Alert vs Existing Alert)

If new activity arrives from the same source IP:

- **The existing alert is reused** if the activity happens within the configured *rotation window*
- **A new alert is created** if the activity occurs after that window

This prevents alerts from staying open indefinitely while still grouping closely related events.

---

## Alert Notifications

Alerts can generate **multiple notifications over time**.

### Notification Types

1. **Initial Notification**
   - Sent immediately when a new alert is created
   - Indicates the start of suspicious or malicious activity

2. **Follow-up Notifications**
   - Sent if the activity continues
   - Scheduled according to alert policy timing
   - Designed to keep users informed without spamming

Notification timing depends on either:
- Honeypot-specific policy
- Or system-wide default settings

---

## Alert Auto-Close

Alerts automatically close if:

- No new activity is detected for a configured duration

This ensures alerts reflect *active threats* and do not remain open forever.

Once auto-closed:
- The alert is no longer considered active
- New activity from the same source will generate a **new alert**

---

## Alert Statuses

From a user perspective, alerts have the following relevant state:

| Status   | Meaning |
|---------|--------|
| Active  | Ongoing activity is detected or expected |
| Closed  | No activity detected for a prolonged period |

---

## What an Alert Represents

An alert answers the question:

> “Is this source IP currently active against this honeypot?”

Rather than one alert per event, the system groups activity to provide:

- Better signal-to-noise ratio
- Clearer timelines
- Fewer but more meaningful notifications

---

## Summary

- Alerts group repeated activity from the same source IP
- They notify users when activity starts and continues
- They automatically close after inactivity
- New alerts are created only when activity meaningfully resumes

This approach balances **visibility**, **context**, and **notification fatigue**.
