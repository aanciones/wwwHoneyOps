# Activity

## Description

The **Activity** module represents events or actions recorded within the system.  
These activities allow users to review and analyze what has happened within an account and a specific honeypot, as well as their relationship with potential alerts.

---

## Relationships

An activity is related to the following elements:

- **Account**: every activity belongs to an account.
- **Honeypot**: every activity is associated with a honeypot.
- **Alert (optional)**: an activity may be linked to an alert, but this is not mandatory.

## Available Features

The system provides several ways to work with activities:

### Filter by account
Allows retrieving only the activities associated with a specific account.

### Filter by honeypot
Allows displaying only the activities related to a specific honeypot.

### Ordering
Activities are displayed from most recent to oldest.  
If multiple activities share the same date, a secondary criterion is used to ensure a consistent order.

## Common Use Cases

- Reviewing recent activity for an account.
- Analyzing events generated by a specific honeypot.

- Displaying chronological event histories.

## Notes

- Activities are designed for auditing, monitoring, and analysis purposes.
- Chronological ordering is essential for correct event interpretation.
- The relationship with alerts is optional, as not all activities trigger an alert.
