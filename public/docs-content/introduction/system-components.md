# System Components

HoneyOps consists of two main components that work together:

1. **One or more Honeypot Appliances (".ova")**, distributed across different VLANs, branch offices, labs or other network segments.  
2. **The HoneyOps Cloud Console**

These components communicate securely and exchange only minimal, security-focused telemetry.

## 1. Honeypot Appliance (".ova")

The honeypot is a self-contained virtual machine delivered as an **Open Virtual Appliance (OVA)**.  
It is deployed inside your own infrastructure — datacenter, branch office, lab network or cloud VM hosting.

### Key characteristics

- **Pre-hardened OS:** No SSH login, no package manager, no configuration required.  
- **Simulated services:** Exposes controlled decoy services to attract attacker interactions.  
- **Small footprint:** Runs with minimal CPU/memory usage.  
- **Outbound-only communication:** All network communication is initiated by the appliance.  
- **Zero access to customer data:** The VM has no ability to inspect or collect production traffic.

### What the appliance sends

- **Heartbeat events:** Status, version, uptime, network reachability.  
- **Incident telemetry:** Information about attacker probes, payloads and behaviour.  
- **Optional policy updates:** Received from the console when policies are modified.

### What the appliance does *not* send

- No production traffic  
- No credentials  
- No file system contents  
- No logs from other systems  
- No packet captures unrelated to honeypot activity

This strict boundary ensures strong privacy and predictable behaviour.

## 2. HoneyOps Cloud Console

The console is the central management plane. It runs in the HoneyOps cloud and provides:

### Management features

- **Honeypot overview:** Health status, last heartbeat, version, metadata.  
- **Activity:** A consolidated record of actions, events and relevant honeypot activity.  
- **Alert view:** Incidents generated by honeypot interactions.  
- **Policies:** Configuration of detection rules and behavioural settings (future expansion).  
- **User & roles management:** Invite users, assign roles (owner, admin, operator, reader).  
- **Account & billing:** Manage organisation profile and licence usage.

### Security properties

- **Multi-tenant isolation** between organisations.  
- **API authentication** using signed tokens per appliance.  
- **HTTPS-only communication** with modern ciphers.  
- **Role-based access control** for all console actions.

## 3. Communication Model

HoneyOps uses a **pull-based**, outbound-only model:

- The appliance periodically contacts the console endpoint.  
- Telemetry and heartbeats are sent over secure HTTPS.  
- The console may return policy changes or licence updates.  
- No inbound ports need to be opened on your network.

This architecture avoids firewall complexity and works on almost any network, including restricted corporate environments.
